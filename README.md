Cipher Final Project
====================

This was the final project for NCS 320 at SUNY Poly, it dealt with Ceaser Ciphers, Monoalphabetic Ciphers, Rail Fence
Ciphers, Row Transposition Ciphers, and Vigenere Ciphers.

All of these ciphers are implemented within this project, not all of them work fully at this current time but that should
be fixed soon, just because the project is submitted doesn't mean that it is over.
